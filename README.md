# Craps 🎰

 ⛳️ In this game we have to use random library.
The game looks like a casino.

🎯 If the sum is randomly 7 or 11 in the game, it should print "You Won"

🎯 If the random sum in the game is 2,3 or 12, it should print "Casino wins"

🎯 If the amount is 4,5,6,8,9,10 randomly in the game, then it should become a goal number. The game will a spin loops if the goal number is equal to what it was before, or the output will be "You won". And if he meets 7 in the loops, then he will lose. 🧩
